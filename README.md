## Hi!
I am a biologist from the University of Antioquia, where I also earned my master’s degree. During my undergraduate studies, I worked on fish community ecology in the northern Andes. For my master’s degree, I focused on distribution patterns and strategies for conserving aquatic ecosystems. Currently, as a PhD student at INECOL, I’m interested in understanding large-scale patterns of species distribution and richness using a biogeographic and macroecological approach—with a special focus on Neotropical freshwater fishes.
